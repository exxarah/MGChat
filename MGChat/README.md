# MGChat

MGChat is a personal experimental project, while I'm learning to use MonoGame.
I'm also figuring out how networking works, so that'll be a thing here.
Think Club Penguin... But without all the fun parts. Just a room you walk around in,
with other people.

## Installation

If there's a build to use, it's on the side. Otherwise, you can run/build Program.cs .
Nothing too unusual or exciting here.

## Contributing

No thankyou <3
